PodShell sychronizes your favorite terminal with your running docker containers, or ssh configurations. 
You won't have to remember the name of your containers anymore, or the ssh port of your servers. PodShell will do it for you, by adding profiles to your terminal. 
All you have to do is start your containers, and a new profile is created in your favorite terminal.
